## Why this project?

I love Epub more than PDF, but I found due to the generation method difference most Epub files cannot pass EpubCheck, some even cannot work with some readers.  

So I made this project to fix the common problems in EPUB files, and make them more comply with standard.  

The standard I follow is the latest Epub 3 standard, which currently is 3.3. Although you can supply with `--epubVer=2` to avoid upgrading Epub 2 to 3, but this project is not designed to output Epub 2 compatible file as this flag only disable some sanitization which is only required since Epub 3. PR for better Epub 2 is welcome, but is not my current focus.  

## Project structure

`EpubSanitizerCore` is the core library provides the sanitization logic. You can add it to your project and call it in your project.  

`EpubSanitizerCLI` is the command line tool to use the core library. It's more user friendly and can be used directly.  

## How to use CLI

`EpubSanitizerCLI -h` to see the help message.  

Since usage may varies across versions, please refer to the help message for the specific version you are using.  

## How to use Core

Add `EpubSanitizerCore` to your project, then you can use the `EpubSanitizer` class to sanitize EPUB files.  

You can refer to the `EpubSanitizerCLI` project for usage examples.  

## Web Version

EpubSanitizer now provides a web version that can be accessed at [EpubSanitizer Web](https://epubsanitizer.qinlili.bid).  

This version contains the same functionality as the desktop version, allowing users to sanitize EPUB files directly in their web browser, but without customization options.

## Plugin Support

Since 1.4.0, EpubSanitizer now supports plugins for additional features. Plugins are used for filters with external dependencies, in order to keep the core library can be lightweight.  

Plugins are disabled by default and you need to enable them manually. This is designed for security concerns, as for maximum flexibility there is no restriction on what plugins can do. You should only use plugins when you know what you want to do and ensure the plugins come from trusted source.  

In CLI version, you can enable plugins by passing `--enablePlugins` to enable all supported plugins. In core library, you can call `PluginManager.EnablePlugin` to enable specific plugins or `PluginManager.EnablePlugins` to enable all supported plugins.  

Plugins should be put in the same folder of core library or CLI executable. Due to .NET limitation of InternalsVisibleTo, supported plugins are hardcoded in core library. So if you want to add your own plugin, you need to modify the core library source code, or use `DemoPlugin` name without modifying core library for testing purpose. You can refer to `DemoPlugin` project to see how to make a plugin.  

There is a project `BuildAllPlugins`, after modifying plugin source code, build this project will copy all built plugins to CLI output folder.  

## Copyright tips

This project will never add features that removing DRM or other copyright protection. We only focus on fixing problems in Epub files with no DRM.  

If you want to report an issue about specific Epub file, please ensure it's legal to share the file in public.
